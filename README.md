# PDFCreator
PDFCreator - The free PDF Converter

This is the public GitHub repository of PDFCreator. Right now, this is a snapshot of our private [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) repository and requires a bit of manual work to get this to compile on your machine. Please fetch a copy of [Ghostscript](https://ghostscript.com) and extract it to the folder `packages\\Ghostscript` (with the bin and lib folder directly into this folder). Then you should be able to compile and run PDFCreator.
